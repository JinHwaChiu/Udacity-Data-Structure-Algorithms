### Task 0

- The time complexity for Python `list` get item is `O(1)`.

Therefore, the time complexity for each line is `O(1)`.

---

### Task 1

- The time complexity for Python `zip` is `O(1)`.
- The time complexity for Python `zip` to `list` is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity for Python `set` is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity for Python `len(set)` is `O(len(s))`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Task 2

- The time complexity for Python `zip` is `O(1)`.
- The time complexity for Python `zip` to `list` is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity for Python `for` loops is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity for Python `list` `in` is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity for Python `list` `append()` is `O(1)`.
- The time complexity for Python `list` `max()` is `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
